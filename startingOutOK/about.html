      <h1>About Starting Out OK</h1>
      <p>
        I started this site because when I was first getting into acting in Oklahoma, I wished there was one place to find casting calls, figure out what gear or classes I needed, and see what was actually going on in the local film community. There wasn’t—so I built it.
      </p>
      <p>
        My own journey started with community theatre and a few small film projects. I had no idea where to look for auditions, who to take classes from, or how to set up a basic voice over space. I spent a lot of time piecing things together from Facebook groups, random websites, and word of mouth. Starting Out OK is my attempt to put that in one spot for the next person.

        This site is for anyone who’s new to acting in Oklahoma—whether you’re in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Norman, or somewhere else in the state. You’ll find casting calls (sourced from around the web and some exclusives), resources like classes and coaches, a vendors section to support people who help new talent, and news about what’s happening in the Oklahoma film scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not a casting director or an agent—just someone who’s been in your shoes and wanted to make the path a little clearer. If you have suggestions or want to share something that helped you, I’d love to hear from you.
