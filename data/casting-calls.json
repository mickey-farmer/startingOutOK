Just as Daria finds the courage to speak, Vivianne initiates a connection that sparks an instant, electric bond. However, the cozy atmosphere shatters when Vivianne discovers Daria's dark reality: she is a creature of the night. Their budding romance is immediately thrust into peril as Sam and Robert, a relentless duo of supernatural trackers, close in on their trail.
