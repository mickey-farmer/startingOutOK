    "description": "In a dimly lit late-night coffee shop, teenage Daria is paralyzed by a crush on Vivianne, the charming barista behind the counter. Just as Daria finds the courage to speak, Vivianne initiates a connection that sparks an instant, electric bond. However, the cozy atmosphere shatters when Vivianne discovers Daria's dark reality: she is a creature of the night. Their budding romance is immediately thrust into peril as Sam and Robert, a relentless duo of supernatural trackers, close in on their trail. In this high-stakes urban fantasy, a simple \"meet-cute\" turns into a desperate fight for survival.",
