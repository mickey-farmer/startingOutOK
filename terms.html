      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 18, 2026</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to Acting Out OK. By using this website, submitting content, or requesting to be listed, you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the site or submit any information.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Nature of the Service</h2>
      <p>
        Acting Out OK is an informational listing site for the Oklahoma acting and film community. We provide casting calls, resources (classes, agencies, theaters, photographers, etc.), and news. All content is provided for information only. We do not employ, represent, endorse, or produce any project, employer, resource, or person listed. We do not verify the accuracy, legality, or quality of any listing or third-party content. Your use of any listing or opportunity is at your own risk.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Resource Listings</h2>
      <p>
        If you request that your business or resource be listed on Acting Out OK:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Informational only.</strong> Listing is for informational purposes only. We are simply making your information visible to visitors. We do not guarantee increased traffic, business, leads, or any commercial benefit as a result of being listed.</li>
        <li><strong>No fee, no commission.</strong> At this time, listing is cost-free. We do not charge a fee for listing, and we do not take any percentage or commission from business you receive, including from leads that may originate from this site. (We may change this in the future; any such change would be communicated and would not apply retroactively without your agreement.)</li>
        <li><strong>No endorsement.</strong> Inclusion on the site does not constitute an endorsement, recommendation, or certification of your services by Acting Out OK. We reserve the right to add, edit, or remove any listing at any time at our sole discretion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="directory-listings">3. Directory Listings</h2>
      <p>
        The Directory on Acting Out OK lists specific people (e.g., crew, specialists, intimacy coordinators) by name and specialty. Because these are individuals, we take consent and accuracy seriously.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent required.</strong> We will only list a person in the Directory if we have received permission from that person (or their authorized representative) to be listed. By submitting a Directory entry, you represent that you have obtained such consent, or that you are the person being listed and you consent to being listed. If we do not receive adequate consent—including if the person objects or we cannot verify consent—we will not list them. We may contact the person or use the contact information you provide to verify consent before adding or keeping a listing.</li>
        <li><strong>No listing without consent.</strong> We reserve the right to decline or remove any Directory listing at any time, including where we have not received or cannot verify consent, where we receive a request for removal from the listed person, or for any other reason at our sole discretion. We are not obligated to state a reason for removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Informational only; no endorsement.</strong> Directory listings are for informational purposes only. Inclusion does not constitute an endorsement, recommendation, or certification by Acting Out OK. We do not verify the accuracy of contact information, credentials, or descriptions. Visitors use Directory information at their own risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Your responsibility.</strong> If you submit a Directory entry for someone other than yourself, you represent that you have the right to provide their information and that you have their consent to be listed. You agree to indemnify Acting Out OK for any claim arising from listing (or failing to list) a person in the Directory, including claims related to consent, accuracy, or removal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Casting Call Listings</h2>
      <p>
        Casting call information on this site is published as submitted to us. We do not verify the accuracy of submissions or the legitimacy of projects or employers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Listing only.</strong> We list the casting call information provided to us. We are not a casting agency, employer, or producer. We do not guarantee that any listing is current, accurate, or compliant with law.</li>
        <li><strong>Updates.</strong> Updates to a casting call listing will be made by our team only when the update is requested by the person who submitted the initial form, or by someone that person has authorized in writing to request updates. We are not responsible for outdated or incorrect information if we have not received an authorized update request.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. News and Editorial Content</h2>
      <p>
        We may publish news, interviews, spotlights, or other editorial content. Acting Out OK’s values include worldwide inclusivity, tolerance, and we take no political or religious stance. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to remove any interview, article, or other content at any time—including to distance Acting Out OK from individuals or organizations whose conduct, history, or values we determine do not align with ours. We are not obligated to state a reason for removal. Removal does not create any claim against us.
      </p>

      <h2 id="news-story-submissions">6. News Story Submissions</h2>
      <p>
        You may suggest a news story for our news blog via the “Suggest a news story” form or a linked page. By submitting a suggestion, you agree to the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Review only.</strong> We will review your suggestion at our discretion. We are not obligated to publish any story, respond to your submission, or use your idea in any way.</li>
        <li><strong>Research and editorial control.</strong> If we decide to pursue a story, we will research it ourselves. We have full editorial control over what we publish, including headline, angle, and content. We may edit, shorten, or combine your suggestion with other sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit.</strong> If we publish a story that originated from your suggestion and we determine it is appropriate to do so, we will credit you as the person who suggested or tipped the story. We do not guarantee that every published story from a suggestion will include your name; our decision depends on the nature of the story and our editorial standards.</li>
        <li><strong>No compensation.</strong> Submitting a news story suggestion is voluntary. We do not pay for tips or suggestions. No monetary or other compensation will be provided for submitting an idea or for any story we publish that resulted from your submission.</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy and rights.</strong> You represent that any information you provide is accurate to the best of your knowledge and that you have the right to share it. You agree not to submit false, misleading, or defamatory content. You are responsible for your submission.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Submissions and Your Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        When you submit a casting call, resource request, directory entry, or other content:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You represent that you have the right to provide the information and that it is accurate to the best of your knowledge.</li>
        <li>You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, and publish the submitted information on Acting Out OK and in related communications.</li>
        <li>You agree not to submit false, misleading, defamatory, or illegal content. You are responsible for your submissions and for any consequences of their publication.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        THE SITE AND ALL CONTENT, LISTINGS, AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WE DO NOT VERIFY, ENDORSE, OR GUARANTEE ANY THIRD-PARTY LISTING, EMPLOYER, RESOURCE, OR OPPORTUNITY. YOU USE THE SITE AND ANY LISTING ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ACTING OUT OK AND ITS OPERATORS, AFFILIATES, AND CONTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE, ANY LISTING, OR ANY THIRD-PARTY CONDUCT. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SITE SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) OR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Acting Out OK and its operators, affiliates, and contributors from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or related to: (a) your use of the site; (b) your submissions or content; (c) your violation of these Terms or any law; or (d) any dispute between you and a third party related to a listing or opportunity found on or through the site.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Third-Party Links and Content</h2>
      <p>
        The site may contain links to third-party websites or content. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party sites, services, or content. Your use of third-party links is at your own risk. Third-party terms and policies apply.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms at any time. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect the most recent change. Continued use of the site or submission of content after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to updated Terms, you must stop using the site and may request removal of your listing(s) by contacting us.
      </p>

      <h2>13. General</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Acting Out OK regarding the site. If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any right does not waive that right. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Oklahoma, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Oklahoma.
      </p>
